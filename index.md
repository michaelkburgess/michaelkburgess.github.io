        <p>Greetings, I'm Michael Burgess, a student currently focused on gaining practical experience in the field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In broad terms, my interests encompass a wide range of subjects, but I primarily focus on exploring the implications of complexity science and, more broadly, examining how the nature of our world informs geographical research.</p>

        <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy rock climbing and delving into football data analysis. These hobbies offer a balance to my professional aspirations, lets go Gunners!</p>

        <p>This website serves as a platform to document my journey into the world of GIS and my endeavors to secure opportunities in the field. Join me as I explore the nuances of geography, data, and the intriguing realm of GIS.</p>

        <p>Whether you share a similar professional interest or simply want to follow along, I encourage you to explore and connect.</p>
